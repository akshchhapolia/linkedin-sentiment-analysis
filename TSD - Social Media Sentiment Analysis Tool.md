# **Technical Specifications Document \- Sentiment Analysis Tool**

## **1\. Overview**

### **Problem Statement**

Many companies receive feedback and user sentiments from various platforms. However, gathering and analyzing this data manually is inefficient. This tool aims to automate sentiment analysis from LinkedIn posts and generate actionable insights.

### **Objective**

To build a tool that analyzes publicly available posts on LinkedIn, extracts sentiment and emotion, categorizes them as positive or negative, and generates a one-page report with actionable insights.

## **2\. Functional Requirements**

### **2.1 Data Collection**

* **Platform**: LinkedIn (Extendable to other platforms like Twitter, Playstore in future)  
* **Data Scope**: Publicly available LinkedIn posts (Non-tagged general mentions allowed)  
* **Data Extraction Method**: Web scraping or LinkedIn API (if available and feasible)

### **2.2 Sentiment Analysis**

* **Type of Analysis**: Emotion classification (Joy, Anger, Sadness, Surprise, etc.)  
* **Models Used**: Pre-trained models (e.g., VADER, BERT, RoBERTa) for simplicity and easy plug-and-play with Cursor  
* **Output Categories**:  
  * Positive  
  * Negative  
  * Neutral  
  * Emotions (e.g., Joy, Anger, Sadness, Surprise)

### **2.3 Report Generation**

* **Trigger**: On-demand report generation  
* **Output Format**: Text-based (Visualizations optional)  
* **Content**:  
  * Number of good reviews (Positive sentiments)  
  * Number of bad reviews (Negative sentiments)  
  * Emotion-wise breakdown (e.g., Joy: 40%, Anger: 20%)  
  * Summary of sentiment analysis  
  * Suggested actionable insights based on detected sentiments

### **2.4 Actionable Insights**

* **Insight Generation Method**: AI-generated recommendations based on sentiment distribution (e.g., "Improve customer support" if complaints are frequent).

## **3\. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 Scalability**

* Initial version supports analysis of **one company at a time**.  
* Extendable to multiple companies in future iterations.

### **3.2 Performance**

* Reports should be generated within **30 seconds** of request.

### **3.3 Compatibility**

* Tool must be compatible with **Cursor** for building and deploying.

## **4\. Tech Stack**

* **Data Extraction**: Web scraping libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Selenium) or LinkedIn API  
* **Sentiment Analysis Models**: Pre-trained models (VADER, BERT, RoBERTa)  
* **Language**: Python (Preferred for compatibility with Cursor)  
* **Visualization Libraries (Optional)**: Matplotlib, Plotly

## **5\. Future Enhancements**

* Support for additional platforms (Twitter, Playstore)  
* Scheduled report generation (e.g., daily, weekly)  
* Integration with dashboards (e.g., Notion, Slack)
